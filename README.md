## Project Part Two Feedback

> Tool Use
 >> Contributions to GitHub by teams were poor..only 7 commits, most issues created by one person, and no pull request seen so far                                                                                           
 >> Fair use of GitHub features like branching or pull requests not seen
> Object-Oriented Analysis
 >> Responsibilies of Ingredient and Recipe are not defined. Keeping an object doesnt makes sense. There is no class to connect or CRUD with DB. 
 >> All adapters say manipulate data of objects, this is an abstract concept, please specify what manipulation means and what data and which objects.
> Other Comments
    >> Please Fix CRC

# Project Part3 Feedback

## Addressing Feedback
3 = 
addressed mostly all feedbacks

## UserInterface Mockup Storyboard
3 = 
Consistent and clear
• Complete UI mockups
• Labeled elements on UI mockups
• Detailed storyboard
• Labeled actions for storyboard transitions
• Covers all requirements
• Intuitive user interface
• Displays understanding of UI mockups and storyboarding

## Sprint Planning

3 = 
- Comprehensive
- Displays understanding of Scrum
- Displays regular and frequent pacing of working software
- Each sprint is reviewed
- User stories are fully “done done” (implemented, tested, integrated, documented)
- Early and frequent integration   

## Demo Ability

3 = 
• Very good Demo ability
• Clear and coherent
• Logically organized by tangible features
• Realistic data and inputs
• All members was present
• Members well coordinated

## Tools Practice
3 = effective use of GitHub tools

## Relative Quality
2 = somewhat above relative quality

## Product Backlog
3 = 
✓ Numbered, tracked, and organized requirements
✓ Tracked, and organized
✓ Comprehensive requirements
✓ Complete story point estimates
✓ Complete risk levels
✓ Requirements noted for half-way checkpoint
✓ New requirements are added to the backlog regularly

## Test Cases

✓ Correct tests wtih realistic data
✘ Inomprehensive unit tests of entity (model) classes (only one test implemented)
✘ incomprehensive intent tests for implemented user stories (all test cases seem to have been compressed into two tests, which is very discouraged)
✘ Most intent tests fail, probably because individual methods were not pre-screened with unit tests first (this is why unit tests are important)

Total = 7.11
