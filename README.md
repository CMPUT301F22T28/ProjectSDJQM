## Project Part Two Feedback

> Tool Use
 >> Contributions to GitHub by teams were poor..only 7 commits, most issues created by one person, and no pull request seen so far                                                                                           
 >> Fair use of GitHub features like branching or pull requests not seen
> Object-Oriented Analysis
 >> Responsibilies of Ingredient and Recipe are not defined. Keeping an object doesnt makes sense. There is no class to connect or CRUD with DB. 
 >> All adapters say manipulate data of objects, this is an abstract concept, please specify what manipulation means and what data and which objects.
> Other Comments
    >> Please Fix CRC
